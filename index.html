                            Hello! Welcome to my website.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            My name is Donghyeon (Don) Lee, and I am currently seeking for Software Engineer opportunities in Asia, particularly Korea and Japan.

                    <h1>About</h1>
                    <p>
                        I graduated from University of California, Berkeley with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in December 2019. My main focus is backend engineering with Python and Java as primary languages. But I am also very interested in frontend engineering with fluency in JavaScript and experience in ReactJS and ReduxJS. Other languages that I am fluent in includes HTML/CSS, C/C++, and SQL. Using these skills and techniques, I wish to learn more about backend and full-stack development, hoping to head in this direction for my career path.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I also have some experience with computer hardware and microcontrollers, specifically Arduino and Raspberry Pi. From one of my previous internships, I have written codes and debugged with these devices.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        As for spoken languages, I can read, write, and speak both English and Korean at a native level. I am currently studying Japanese, aiming for JLPT N3.

                    <h2>Exercise</h2>
                    <p>
                        I typically dedicate my time to working out at the gym, as my profession typically requires me to spend the majority of my time sitting at the computer. Engaging in physical activities became a fulfilling and enjoyable way for me to balance out the sedentary nature of software engineering. Besides weightlifting, I also enjoy a variety of sports such as tennis, archery, and swimming.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Art</h2>
                    <p>
                        I often find pleasure in sketching and creating paintings. Growing up under my parents, both who are art majors, I've been exposed to fine arts since childhood. <i>(One of my artworks is showcased at the end of this website!)</i> However, I derive greater enjoyment from admiring artworks than producing them myself. During my leisure hours, I sometimes take a journey to art museums and galleries, especially when they feature special exhibitions. I enjoy delving into the creations of other artists, discovering fresh outlooks on the world through their work.
